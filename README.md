# Bank-ATM-Management-System

This is a controlled-based application designed using five different Java Classes namely:
Account, Transaction, ATM, Bank, and User. 

In this program:
• The user can register himself as a Customer who is going to have at least one Savings Account in the given Bank. (By Default)
• The user can open several other accounts under his Unique Universal I.D.(UUID) in the Bank.
• Once registered as a Customer in the Bank, the user can perform operations like:
####    Displaying his/her Transaction History for any given Account.
####    Withdraw funds from any given Account.
####    Deposit funds in any given Account.
####    Transfer funds from any given Account to any other required Account.

       

The major goal is to create an ATM Interface. This will be able to display all the functionalities that an actual ATM display does. To perform all the operations in the system, the user will need to enter his/her Unique Universal I.D. and his/her ATM Pin. 


If the user enters the correct details, then only he/she will be able to access other options. After entering the correct details, the user can see his/her bank details like account balance, transaction history, and so on. The user can also withdraw, deposit and transfer funds from one account to another.
